    This section documents my thoughts and learnings throughout the project, serving as a reference for myself and for anyone interested in how this project was built.

# Phase 1 Notes

During Phase 1, the core features were defined and the technologies to be used throughout the project were selected.

The goal is to build this project in a professional, production-ready manner.

The planned tech stack includes a Layered Architecture design pattern, a database integration, at least five RESTful API endpoints, and a documentation page demonstrating how the API can be consumed using different programming languages.

I successfully ran the project and tested the first API endpoint.

Now I want to connect the project to GitHub and make my first commit.



# Phase 2 Notes

I have successfully uploaded the project code to GitHub.

I am now planning which API endpoints I need to create.

Considering using Swagger to test and document the API.

I used AI tools to enhance the design and improve the UI/UX.
